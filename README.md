# Partner-Locator-Search

Partner Locator Search allows Salesforce Partners (PRM) customers to expose their partner directory on the public internet, the partner portal, or the customer portal. The Partner Finder can be used by customers to locate a qualified reseller, VAR, distributor, or consulting firm within a particular geographic area. Likewise, it can be used to facilitate partner to partner collaboration by allowing partners to search for other partners with specific skill sets. The Partner Locator Search allows for searching by name, attribute, or location (geo-proximity).
